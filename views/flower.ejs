        <div class="info-container">
          <p><span class="bold">Language:</span>JavaScript,Css,HTML</p>
          <p>Made in: 2024</p>
          <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
          <p>This is a small website I made to showcase flowers where you can add and delete flowers along with viewing them</p>
          <p><b>Development</b></p>
          <p>This website was build using HTML,CSS ,JavaScript and MySql.</p>
          <p>The main challenges I faced was trying to link what the user added or deleted from the website to the sql database.But the making of this website
            has taught me alot about JavaScript and how to use MySql.
          </p>
          <p><b>Design</b></p>
          <p>When chooseing colour I wanted to make the website colour to look soft and easy on the eyes.I wanted the website colour to give a woody feel so that it meshes well with the flowers
            flowers I wanted to display
          </p>

        <p><b>Final thoughts</b></p>
        <p>I had a lot of fun making this website as this was the first website I have made.The next time I do this I would like to add in a user and a admin function to diffciate the functions</p>
        <br>
          <p>The website is hosted on render it might take some time to load</p>
