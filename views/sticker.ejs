        <p>This is a sticker I made using Illustrator. You can download and use it on WhatsApp and Telegram.</p>
        <p>Made in: 2024</p>
        <p><b>Design explanation</b></p>
        <p>When I was coming up with sticker designs, I thought about what stickers I would usually use and came up with two categories:</p>
        <p>The first category is cute stickers, which are usually small anthropomorphic animals or people expressing feelings.</p>
        <p>The second category is stickers with jokes or memes, often expressing feelings through humor or reaction.</p>
        <p>Knowing this, I decided to go with the first category of cute characters. I chose a battery as the character during its creation because I wanted a sci-fi or engineering theme, and a battery fit well.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the sketches I made:</p>

        <div class="image-grid">
            <img src="/images/sketch1.png" alt="sketch 1" />
            <img src="/images/sketch2.png" alt="sketch 2" />
            <img src="/images/sketch3.png" alt="sketch 3" />
            <img src="/images/sketch4.png" alt="sketch 4" />   
        </div>

        <p><b>Review:</b></p>
        <p>Doing this help me understand about branding and about consistency in desgin. I learnt a lot when making This
            there was a few things I struggle when making this like how to make the character eye catching and funny
        </p>
        <p>I feel like I could improve the chatacter design overall but I think the colours worked well</p>

        <button onclick="scrollToPortfolio()" class="btn btn-primary">Back to Portfolio</button>
    </div>

    <script>
        function scrollToPortfolio() {
            window.location.href = '/#portfolio'; 
        }
    </script>
