        <p><b>Language:</b>C++</p>
        <p><b>Platform:</b>Unity</p>
        <p>Made in:2024</p>
        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
        <p>This is Escape the graveyard.A VR puzzle escape room.This was created in unity.This was my first 3d project and my first game I have created</p>
        <p><b>Design</b></p>
        <p>When making this I was going for a cartoon horror style.My first idea for this was a witch hut but scrapped the idea as I felt that the area to play was a bit too small
            so I change it to a graveyard where it gave me more space to design and to add in puzzle that are bigger so the player can move around more
        </p>
        <p><b>Results of the puzzle design</b></p>
        <div class="image-grid">
            <img src="/images/EscapeS1.png" alt="Escape 1" />
            <img src="/images/EscapeS2.png" alt="Escape 2" />
            <img src="/images/EscapeS3.png" alt="Escape 3" />
            <img src="/images/EscapeS4.png" alt="Escape 4" />
        </div>

        <p><b>Development</b></p>
        <p>When making this I face quite a few challenges as this was the first time I have ever touched unity and C++.But through out the process of learning and creating the first
            This project has also help me learn more about C++ as a coding language I struggled to develop some of the puzzles in this game but I had manage to do it thanks to some research on the internet
        </p>
        


        <p><b>Final thoughts</b></p>
        <p>Through out this entire projects I have learned a lot of things about VR and game design in general
            It thought me a lot about how to learn by myself,for example the wire cutting puzzle and how to do animations in unity and how to trigger them.
            It taught me that making games was not as easy as I thought it would be and that there is a lot of things to learn in order to make a good game.
            If I have a chance in the future I would like to try my hand in making a 2D game next time.
